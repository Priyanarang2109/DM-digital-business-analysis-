# Tripadvisor-Review-dataset
This was the review dataset from tripadvisor of 21 hotels in The Strip, Las Vegas. Performed various data cleaning steps and made correlation heatmaps and performed anova to select the best features. Spend a lot of time in gaining insights from the data and creating a number of features. Finaly implemented an SVM and an xgboost model. Skewed the number of classes by merging some of them together as data points for them were very less.
